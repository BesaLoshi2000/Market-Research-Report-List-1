<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DR Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect DR Detector</li><li>Direct DR Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The DR (Digital Radiography) detector market is segmented into two main types: indirect and direct DR detectors. Indirect DR detectors use a two-step process to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by a digital sensor, offering high image quality. In contrast, direct DR detectors directly convert X-rays into electrical signals, providing faster imaging and processing times. Both types are crucial in modern medical imaging, enhancing diagnostic capabilities and workflow efficiency in radiology departments.</p></p>
