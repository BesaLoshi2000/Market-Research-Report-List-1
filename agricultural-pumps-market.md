<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal pumps</li><li>Displacement pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural pumps market primarily consists of two types: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotational energy to move water, making them ideal for high flow rates and low-viscosity fluids, which are commonly needed in irrigation systems. Displacement pumps, on the other hand, operate by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it out, making them suitable for high-pressure applications or viscous liquids. Both types serve essential roles in optimizing agricultural efficiency and enhancing water management practices.</p></p>
