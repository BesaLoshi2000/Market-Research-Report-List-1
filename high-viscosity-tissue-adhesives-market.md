<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Viscosity Tissue Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-OCA</li><li>n-2BCA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High viscosity tissue adhesives, specifically 2-Octyl Cyanoacrylate (2-OCA) and n-Butyl Cyanoacrylate (n-2BCA), are critical in medical applications for wound closure and tissue bonding. 2-OCA is favored for its flexibility and lower toxicity, making it suitable for skin and delicate tissues. In contrast, n-2BCA offers strong adhesion and is used for more robust applications. Both types function by polymerizing on contact with moisture, forming a durable bond that promotes healing while minimizing infection risks.</p></p>
