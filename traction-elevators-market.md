<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Traction Elevators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Geared Traction Elevators</li><li>Gearless Traction Elevators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The traction elevators market is primarily divided into two categories: geared and gearless traction elevators. Geared traction elevators utilize a system of gears to connect the motor to the sheave, providing precise control and moderate speeds, making them suitable for medium-rise applications. In contrast, gearless traction elevators operate without gears, allowing for higher efficiency and smoother rides at greater speeds, making them ideal for high-rise buildings. Both types capitalize on traction mechanisms for effective vertical transportation.</p></p>
