<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Sealed Manometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>U Tube Manometers</li><li>Inclined Tube Manometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diaphragm sealed manometer market includes two primary types: U-tube manometers and inclined tube manometers. U-tube manometers consist of a U-shaped glass tube filled with fluid, measuring pressure differences based on fluid height. Inclined tube manometers, on the other hand, are designed to provide greater precision by using an inclined tube, allowing for smaller pressure changes to be measured more accurately. Both types are widely used in various industries for monitoring pressure in systems where fluid exposure is undesirable.</p></p>
